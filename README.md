# Data-Curation-and-Analysis
This project's population data for nations and dependent territories are web-scraped from a Wikipedia page, cleaned and analyzed, and significant demographic numbers are visualized. The project seeks to lighten the distribution of the world's population, its share, and the sources of demographic data for various nations and dependent territories.
Data Cleaning:

- The "Population" column is cleaned to remove commas.
- The "% of World" column removes percentage symbols and converts them to float values.
- The "Date" column is standardized to the full month name format.

Project Outputs:

1. A cleaned data set is stored in the CSV file "Countries_and_Dependencies_by_Population.csv."

2. Data visualization and analysis to comprehend population distributions and trends using histograms and bar charts.
